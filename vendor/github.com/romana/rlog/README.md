# rlog - A simple Golang logger with lots of features and no external dependencies

Rlog is a simple logging package, rich in features. It is configurable 'from
the outside' via environment variables and/or config file and has no
dependencies other than the standard Golang library.

It is called "rlog", because it was originally written for the
[Romana project](https://github.com/romana/romana). 


## Features

* Logging configuration of a running process can be modified, without needing
  to restart it. This allows for on-demand finer level logging, if a process
  starts to experience issues, for example.
* Is configured through environment variables or config file: No need to call a
  special init function of some kind to initialize and configure the logger.
* A new config file can be specified and applied programmatically at any time.
* Offers familiar and easy to use log functions for the usual levels: Debug,
  Info, Warn, Error and Critical.
* Offers an additional multi level logging facility with arbitrary depth,
  called Trace.
* Log and trace levels can be configured separately for the individual files
  that make up your executable.
* Every log function comes in a 'plain' version (to be used like Println)
  and in a formatted version (to be used like Printf). For example, there
  is Debug() and Debugf(), which takes a format string as first parameter.
* Can be configured to print caller info (module filename and line, function
  name).
* Has NO external dependencies, except things contained in the standard Go
  library.
* Fully configurable date/time format.
* Logging of date and time can be disabled (useful in case of systemd, which
  adds its own time stamps in its log database).
* By default logs to stderr or stdout. A logfile can be configured via
  environment variable. Output may happen exclusively to the logfile or in
  addition to the output on stderr/stdout. Also, a different output stream
  or file can be specified from within your programs at any time.


## Defaults

Rlog comes with reasonable defaults, so you can just start using it without any
configuration at all. By default:

* Log level set to INFO.
* Trace messages are not logged.
* Time stamps are logged with each message.
* No caller information.
* Output is sent to stderr.

All those defaults can easily be changed through environment variables or the
config file.


## Controlling rlog through environment or config file variables

Rlog is configured via the following settings, which may either be defined as
environment variables or via a config file.

* RLOG_LOG_LEVEL: Set to "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR", "CRITICAL" or
  "NONE". Any message of a level >= than what's configured will be printed. If
  this is not defined it will default to "INFO". If it is set to "NONE" then
  all logging is disabled, except Trace logs, which are controlled via a
  separate variable. In addition, log levels can be set for individual files
  (see below for more information). Default: INFO - meaning that INFO and
  higher is logged.
* RLOG_TRACE_LEVEL: "Trace" log messages take an additional numeric level as
  first parameter. The user can specify an arbitrary number of levels. Set
  RLOG_TRACE_LEVEL to a number. All Trace messages with a level <=
  RLOG_TRACE_LEVEL will be printed. If this variable is undefined, or set to -1
  then no Trace messages are printed. The idea is that the higher the
  RLOG_TRACE_LEVEL value, the more 'chatty' and verbose the Trace message
  output becomes. In addition, trace levels can be set for individual files
  (see below for more information). Default: Not set - meaning that no trace
  messages are logged.
* RLOG_CALLER_INFO: If this variable is set to "1", "yes" or something else
  that evaluates to 'true' then the message also contains the caller
  information, consisting of the file and line number as well as function name
  from which the log message was called. Default: No - meaning that no caller
  info is logged.
* RLOG_TIME_FORMAT: Use this variable to customize the date/time format. The
  format is specified either by the well known formats listed in
  https://golang.org/src/time/format.go, for example "UnixDate" or "RFC3339".
  Or as an example date/time output, which is described here:
  https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Format Default: Not set - formatted
  according to RFC3339.
* RLOG_LOG_NOTIME: If this variable is set to "1", "yes" or something else
  that evaluates to 'true' then no date/time stamp is logged with each log
  message. This is useful in environments that use systemd where access to the
  logs via their logging tools already gives you time stamps. Default: No -
  meaning that time/date is logged.
* RLOG_LOG_FILE: Provide a filename here to determine if the logfile should
  be written to a file, in addition to the output stream specified in
  RLOG_LOG_STREAM. Default: Not set - meaning that output is not written to a
  file.
* RLOG_LOG_STREAM: Use this to direct the log output to a different output
  stream, instead of stderr. This accepts three values: "stderr", "stdout" or
  "none". If either stderr or stdout is defined here AND a logfile is specified
  via RLOG_LOG_FILE then the output is sent to both. Default: Not set -
  meaning the output goes to stderr.

There are two more settings, related to the configuration file, which can only
be set via environment variables.

* RLOG_CONF_FILE: If this variable is set then rlog looks for the config
  file at the specified location, which needs to be the absolute path of the
  file. If this variable is not defined, then rlog will look for the config
  file in "/etc/rlog/your-executable-name.conf". Therefore, by default every
  executable has its own config file. By setting this variable, you could
  force multiple processes to share the same config file.
  Note that with the SetConfFile() function you can specify a new config file
  programmatically at any time, even with a relative path.
* RLOG_CONF_CHECK_INTERVAL: Number of seconds between checking whether the
  config file has changed. By default, this is set to 15 seconds. This means
  that within 15 seconds a changed logging configuration in the config file
  will take effect. Note that this check is only performed when a log message
  is actually written. If the program does nothing or doesn't log messages, the
  config file won't be read. If there is no config file or it has been removed
  then the configuration from the environment variables is used. Set this value
  to 0 in order to switch off the regular config file checking: The config file
  will then only be read once at the start.

Please note! If these environment variables have incorrect or misspelled
values then they will be silently ignored and a default value will be used.


## Using the config file

A config file for rlog is entirely optional, since rlog works just fine even
without it. However, it does provide you with a very neat feature: You can
change the logging configuration of a running program without having to restart
it!

When rlog is imported it starts out with the defaults described above. It then
takes an initial configuration from environment variables, which may override
the default values. Next, it looks for the rlog config file. If it cannot find
the config file it will quietly continue without error. If the config file is
found then the configuration from environment variables is combined with the
configuraton from the config file. More about how this combination works, and
what takes precedence, in a moment.

### Updating the logging config of a running program

Every time you log a message and at least RLOG_CONF_CHECK_INTERVAL seconds have
elapsed since the last reading of the config file, rlog will automatically
re-read the content of the conf file and re-apply the configuration it finds
there over the initial configuration, which was based on the environment
variables.

You can always just delete the config file to go back to the configuration
based on environment variables.

### Logfile location

The absolute path for the config file can be set via the RLOG_CONF_FILE
environment variable. Absent that, rlog looks for a config file in
"/etc/rlog/your-executable-name.conf". This means that you can easily provide
different logging configurations for each of your processes.

A new config file location can also be specified at any time via the
SetConfFile() function. An absolute or relative path may be specfied with that
function.

### Logfile format

The format of the logfile is simple. Each setting is referred to by the same
name as the environment variable. So, your config file may look like this:

    # Comment lines start with a '#'
    RLOG_LOG_LEVEL  = WARN
    RLOG_LOG_STREAM = stdout
    RLOG_TIME_FORMAT= UnixDate
    RLOG_LOG_FILE   = /var/log/myapp.log

A few notes about config file formatting:

* Empty lines, or lines starting with '#' are ignored.
* Leading and trailing spaces in lines are removed.
* Everything after the first '=' will be taken as the value of the setting.
* Leading and trailing spaces in values are removed.
* Spaces or further '=' characters within values are taken as they are.

### Combining configuration from environment variables and config file

Generally, environment variables take precedence. Assume you have set a log
level of INFO via the RLOG_LOG_LEVEL variable. This value will be used,
even if you specified DEBUG in the config file, since an explicitly set
environment variable takes precedence.

There are only two cases when a config file value takes precedence:

1. If you do not have an explicit value set in the environment variable. For
   example, if you do not have the RLOG_LOG_LEVEL environment variable defined
   at all, or if it is set to the empty string.
2. If you apply a '!' as prefix in the config file. That marks this value as
   higher priority than the environment variable. Consider the following config
   file as example. Here RLOG_LOG_LEVEL and RLOG_TIME_FORMAT will take
   precedence over whatever was defined in the environment variables.

An example of using '!' in the config file:

    !RLOG_LOG_LEVEL=WARN
    RLOG_LOG_STREAM=stdout
    !RLOG_TIME_FORMAT=UnixDate
    RLOG_LOG_FILE=/var/log/myapp.log


## Per file level log and trace levels

In most cases you might want to set just a single log or trace level, which is
then applied to all log messages in your program. With environment variables,
you would set it like this:

    export RLOG_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
    export RLOG_TRACE_LEVEL=3

However, with rlog the log and trace levels can not only be configured
'globally' with a single value, but can also independently be set for the
individual module files that were compiled into your executable. This is useful
if enabling high trace levels or DEBUG logging for the entire executable would
fill up logs or consume too many resources.

For example, if your executable is compiled out of several files and one of
those files is called 'example.go' then you could set log levels like this:

    export RLOG_LOG_LEVEL=INFO,example.go=DEBUG

This sets the global log level to INFO, but for the messages originating from
the module file 'example.go' it is DEBUG.

Similarly, you can set trace levels for individual module files:

    export RLOG_TRACE_LEVEL=example.go=5,2

This sets a trace level of 5 for example.go and 2 for everyone else.

More examples:

    # DEBUG level for all files whose name starts with 'ex', WARNING level for
    # everyone else.
    export RLOG_LOG_LEVEL=WARN,ex*=DEBUG

    # DEBUG level for example.go, INFO for everyone else, since INFO is the
    # default level if nothing is specified.
    export RLOG_LOG_LEVEL=example.go=DEBUG

    # DEBUG level for example.go, no logging for anyone else.
    export RLOG_LOG_LEVEL=NONE,example.go=DEBUG

    # Multiple files' levels can be specified at once.
    export RLOG_LOG_LEVEL=NONE,example.go=DEBUG,foo.go=INFO

    # The default log level can appear anywhere in the list.
    export RLOG_LOG_LEVEL=example.go=DEBUG,INFO,foo.go=WARN

Note that as before, if in RLOG_LOG_LEVEL no global log level is specified then
INFO is assumed to be the global log level. If in RLOG_TRACE_LEVEL no global
trace level is specified then -1 (no trace output) is assumed as the global
trace level.


## Usage example

    import "github.com/romana/rlog"

    func main() {
 	   rlog.Debug("A debug message: For the developer")
 	   rlog.Info("An info message: Normal operation messages")
 	   rlog.Warn("A warning message: Intermittent issues, high load, etc.")
 	   rlog.Error("An error message: An error occurred, I will recover.")
 	   rlog.Critical("A critical message: That's it! I give up!")
 	   rlog.Trace(2, "A trace message")
 	   rlog.Trace(3, "An even deeper trace message")
    }
